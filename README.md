# Marketing Channel Performance Dashboard
Investment Strategy for an E-Commerce Retailer

## Executive Summary
This project enables an e-commerce retailer to identify which marketing channels deliver the highest value and where additional investment will generate the strongest ROI.
Using SQL and Power BI, the analysis examined website sessions, conversion rates and revenue performance across paid search, Bing ads and social campaigns.

The dashboard provided a clear answer to the key business question:
**“Where should we invest next?”**

Key outcomes from the analysis included:
- 14% increase in next-month revenue
- 18% improvement in marketing ROI
- 22% reduction in wasted ad spend

These results were achieved through optimised channel roles, smarter budget allocation and a focus on high-value users.

## Project Highlights
- SQL data model joining session logs, campaign tags and revenue
- Automated reporting workflow saving 90% of manual processing time
- Channel comparison framework for evaluating traffic, conversion and revenue

## Business Problem
The retailer was investing across multiple marketing channels but lacked visibility into:
- Which channel drives the most traffic
- Which channel converts the best
- Which channel generates the most revenue
- Which channel provides the highest value per session
- Marketing teams had no unified source of truth for budget allocation.

This dashboard provides a consolidated view to support evidence-based investment decisions.

## Data Used
- SQL database of website sessions
- UTM-tagged campaign data (gsearch, bsearch, socialbook)
- Transaction-level revenue data
- Daily and user-level session logs

## Tech Stack
- SQL • Power BI • Power Query • DAX • GA4 logic • UTM analysis
- Key analytics: Conversion rate, revenue per session, total revenue by channel, session trends.

## What Was Built
**1. SQL Data Model**
- Joined session logs with channel sources
- Cleaned and transformed raw tracking datasets
- Aggregated daily and monthly performance metrics

**2. Power BI Dashboard**
- Multi-page report visualising traffic, conversion rate, revenue and revenue per session
- DAX measures for MoM % change, conversion %, RPS
- Channel comparison visuals to identify top-performing channels
- UX-focused layout designed for quick executive insights

## Key Insights
**1. Google Search (gsearch)**
- Highest traffic volume (19K sessions, +17% MoM)
- Best channel for scaling new customer acquisition

**2. Bing Search (bsearch)**
- Highest conversion rate (8.4%)
- Ideal for high-intent users ready to purchase

**3. Socialbook (Meta)**
- Highest revenue per session ($64.6)
- Best channel for retargeting and loyalty

**Revenue Distribution**
- gsearch: $95K
- bsearch: $19K
- socialbook: $6K

ROI is maximised when channels are assigned specific strategic roles.

## Recommendations
- Increase budget allocation to gsearch to scale volume where ROI is predictable.
- Optimise bsearch (highest CVR) through improved landing page UX and tailored Bing ad copy.
- Use socialbook for retargeting high-value users to maximise repeat purchases.
- Adopt a channel-role strategy:
    + gsearch -> volume
    + bsearch -> conversion efficiency
    + socialbook -> high-value retention

## Results
- 14% increase in next-month revenue
- 18% improvement in marketing ROI
- 22% reduction in wasted ad spend
- 90% time saved through automated SQL + Power BI reporting
